# A Comparison Study between Dense NLP vs CNN based predictions for CIFAR-10 dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 50,000 32x32x3 (32x32 pixels, RGB channels) training images and 10,000 testing images (also 32x32x3), divided into the following 10 categories:

    1. Airplane
    2. Automobile
    3. Bird
    4. Cat
    5. Deer
    6. Dog
    7. Frog
    8. Horse
    9. Ship
    10. Truck
    
In this project we created a classifier for the CIFAR-10 dataset.
